    <b>season 1 episode 1</b>
camera zooms in on a shitty apartment, that looks like it should've been closed down years ago
Tom "I can't believe I've got to stay here, unfortunately it's all I can afford"
tom enters the apartment block, dodging mounds of pizza boxes
Voice 1 "STOP DRINKING THE HOT DOG WATER YOU DISGUSTING FUCK"
Voice 2 "THEN WHAT'S THE POINT OF THE WATER IF NOBODY DRINKS IT"
Laugh track plays
tom knocks on the door waiting for the horror of who his roommates might be
Voice 3 "that must be our new roommate"
Voice 2 "or even better the delivery guy"
the door slowly opens up to reveal a barely lit room and stood before tom was zak(voice 3)
Zak "you must be our roommate"
Tom "is now a good time, I heard shouting"
Voice 1 "MATTHEW DON'T START DRINKING THE SOY SAUCE"
Matthew "Travis I will do what the fuck I want, that includes chugging a gallon of soy sauce"
fades to black for intermission
Matthew barges past zak, sauce dripping from his mouth as he greets tom
Matthew "Do you have food?"
Tom "what?"
Matthew "YOU'RE NOT THE DELIVERY GUY REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE"
Travis and zak wrestle Matthew to the floor to stop him from unhinging his jaw and eating tom whole
Tom "I'm here for the vacancy"
??? "Oh another BESTIE has come to join the gang"
an eerie silence now hangs over the gang as the landlady marches down the corridor
Lisa "So bestieeeeeeee you wish to live here, give me a reason to let you stay"
tom visibly scared by the commanding presence of the landlady gives the only reason he can
Tom "as you can see I'm white as a ghost, that is because I am a Victorian chimney sweep and died from soot, and for free I will clean this buildings chimneys, that is why I should stay"
Lisa "well bestie looks like you can stay"
Travis "he does look like a bit of a twink though"


    <b>Season 1 episode 2</b>
Night finally settles in on the apartment as tom finally takes a rest from cleaning chimneys
Tom "the rent is cheap and at least I can help by cleaning chimneys"
tom begins to close his eyes, settling for the night
Matthew "CHICKEN TENDIES REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE, WHO THE FUCK ATE MY TENDIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES MY FUCKING NUGGIES MY FUCKING CHOCKEN"
Tom "Uh oh"
tom rushes and opens his door, to ne met with a sinister shadow looming over him
Matthew "Tendies"
Tom "w-what?"
Matthew "CHICKEN"
Zak "TOM FUCKING RUN"
tom uses his ghost powers to run through the walls until he gets to the hallway
Tom "that was close"
a sudden boom is heard, similar to the sound barrier breaking as a ball rolls through the wall behind tom
Matthew "REEEEEEEEEEEE"
Tom "holy fuck"
tom continues to run from the boulder that is Matthew, which tramples everything in its wake
Tom "I didn't eat of your tendies dumbass"
matthew seems to ignore everything tom says and continues on his brutal warpath
Zak "Matthew this is the second fucking time you've forgotten you've eaten your tendies"
Lisa "BESTIE WHY ARE YOU DESTROYING THE APARTMENT"
lisa then prepares to stop the rolling ball of death that is Matthew
Lisa "BESTIE YOU ARE NOT PREPARED TO FACE ME"
Luckily for lisa the apartment is run down and the floor splits and matthew falls into someones apartment
??? "Hello"
Matthew "hi, what are you doing?"
??? "I'm just sat here
... eating lettuce"
Lisa "BESTIE it looks like you'll need to pay damages"
matthew enters his lawyer accent
Matthew "oi vey Lisa the apartment was run down before we got here, however I can cut a deal, I will be your lawyer free of charge from now on"
lisa mulls over the offer
Lisa "but BESTIE why would I need a lawyer" lisa retorts with a sinister grin
Matthew "because you will have a bunch of legal cases on your hands if anyone finds out about the asbestos in the apartment oi vey"
??? "There is asbestos? Damn, and I was just say here eating lettuce"
visibly perturbed lisa returns to her apartment
??? "Have some lettuce for your troubles"


    <b>Season 1 episode 3</b>
we pan to the gang sitting down in a KFC eating their orders
Matthew "So I said to the judge, my client would like to plead on the grounds of being based. And he was like, your client assaulted three women with a baguette telling them to get in the kitchen and make a sandwich. So anyway how's everyone else doing?"
Zak "you are literally the worst lawyer I've ever heard of"
Tom "do you actually win any cases"
Matthew "what are you on about, my client was deemed not guilty"
Zak "HOW?!?"
Matthew "anyway, Travis why didn't you get anything?"
Travis "KFC just isnt as good as McDonald's, nothing beats their chicken nuggies"
??? "WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU JUST SAY, IS THAT HERESY IN MY PLACE OF WORK!!!!"
the audience gasp as the owner of this authoritative voice enters view
??? "LEAVE THIS ESTABLISHMENT NOW BLASPHEMER"
Matthew "who are you?"
??? "I'm Joe"
Matthew "I know you"
Travis "yeah JOE MAMA"
the audience and other customers erupt into laughter as Joe becomes infuriated, annoyed, irate even
Joe "ILL KILL YOU, YOU INSECT"
the ground rumbles as an army of chickens ready around Joe, ready to kill the heretic who sits before him without a meal
the chicken army rushes the gang
Joe "go my willing soldiers kill this heretic and his conspirators"
Travis "insidias lacrimis da mihi potestatem"
travis's hair starts levitating and strangling chickens
Matthew "ball time"
matthew curls into a ball and starts spinning at 4000 rpm, then proceeds to crush everything in his path
Zak "breg lend me your powers"
green light beams out of his eyes and mouth as all chickens who touch him disintegrate, meanwhile tom stands there doing nothing
the endless horde of chicken seems to only be bolstering in its forces, much to the dismay of the gang
Travis "I'll end this by targeting the leader"
Travis's hair reaches joe, and just as it's about to reach him joe effortlessly cuts through his hair
Joe "you fool, you should know better than to DISRESPECT THE EXTRA CRISPY COLONEL"
Lettuce lover "damn, I guess I'll help"
lettuce lover joins in by hurtling his lettuce at each chicken at mach 2 speeds, but it does little to help
suddenly a familiar silhouette appears through the door
Lisa "Hey BESTIES, need help"
matthew finishes eating a chicken whole and screams"WHAT DOES IT FUCKING LOOK LIKE"
lisa "no need to be so angry BESTIE, joe I suggest you give up now"
Joe "why should the extra crispy colonel give up while hes protecting everything he stands for?"
Lisa "I have a photo BESTIE of you eating at McDonald's"
Joe visibly shaken "I have no idea what you mean"
Lisa "you claim my BESTIE is a heretic, while I have proof of you partaking in a McDonald's meal"
Joe "it was one time, IT WAS ONE TIME. AND IF ANYTHING ME WORKING SO HARD TO KILL THIS HERETIC SHOWS HOW MUCH I LOVE KFC"
lisa "SHIT, my one power, gaslighting didn't work. I must call HIM"


    <b>Season 1 episode 4</b>
Lisa "I need your help, gaslighting didnt work this guy must be a religious nutjob, I'll pay you overtime, see you soon"
Joe "NO MATTER WHO YOU CALL, YOU CANT BE SAVED"
the ground shakes as a blinding light makes a human form and manifests to reveal a modest man in scruffy overalls
??? "you rang"
the humble voice that emanates from this being shakes the ground
Joe "ILL DESTROY YOU ASWELL. CHICKENS ATTACK"
the mysterious man in overalls rips off his top half revealing his chest and proceeds to grow taller and taller and seeming to become more buff and stronger by the second as a divine light shines
Joe "WHO... NO WHAT ARE YOU"
matthew "hes a sigma male, a god among men"
Lisa "that is the janitor, James the sigma"
the being known as james now stands at 10 foot tall and has biceps that when flexed cause shockwaves which destroy the buildings infrastructure
James "surrender now, I will not ask a second time"
Joe visibly perturbed "I'll destroy you myself"
joe charges at james, sword first. James simply touches the blade and it shatters. James then claps his hands, the proceeding boom obliterated the chickens
James "come let us leave this place, we shall migrate"
Matthew "where to?"
James "pizza hut"
joe mourns his chickens deaths as the gang leave to pizza hut. After the gang has exited a shadowy figure that exudes a sweet aroma and had effeminate features walks up to joe
Effeminate man "I can help you get revenge"


    <b>Season 1 episode 5</b>
we see the gang in their apartment sat around doing their own thing, relaxing after the previous episodes debacle with joe
Tom "the tv has nothing on but absolute shit these days"
Matthew "put judge Judy on"
Tom "why would you want to watch judge Judy, you just got home from court, that's like a person from Manchester coming home from a hard day of robbing and playing GTA"
Matthew "I like seeing commoners go to prison and lose money"
tom switches channels to judge judy
Zak "that defendant looks familiar"
Travis "yeah it does, is that Sedgwick"
Matthew "they finally got him for being a nonce huh?"
tom changes the channel once again
Advert on tv "do you need a brand new car, then come down to Jones's car dealership with deals as low as Â£5,000"
Matthew "oi vey, 5 grand he wants for that automobile, you can steal one for less and then hire me to defend you for cheaper"
by luck Matthew's advert came on
Matthew on tv "do you fear being robbed or having other multiple crimes happen to you, good because for a low price you can make me your personal lawyer. Because despite making up 13% of the population..."
tom quickly changes channels to avoid the oncoming statement
The man on the tv starts talking "dont trust the effeminate man"
Travis "wtf"
??? "My names Charlie and I've come to warn you about the effeminate man you'll meet soon, do not trust him"
Travis "believe me I don't trust twinks"
Charlie "good, my time here is up but remember what I said"
the tv goes to static then explodes as the gang share a perturbed smile pondering the possible tumultuous time ahead of them


    <b>Season 1 episode 6</b>
we zoom in on travis and matthew at breakfast, discussing last nights events
Matthew "who do you you think the femboy is?"
Travis "well, it cant be the two of us, we are the least effeminate people on the planet"
Matthew "what about my luscious locks"
Travis "shut the fuck up. Tom looks pretty effeminate"
Matthew "if it was him, charlie would've given us the warning earlier"
Travis "could be lisa?"
Matthew "Charlie said effeminate man"
Travis "you've clearly never been to Thailand"
Matthew "it could be Toby"
Travis "impossible, we thwarted him in season 0"
Matthew "yeah but the writer lacks continuity, and has ran out of villains for this monster if the week bullshit"
suddenly the door to the apartment is launched across the room
Matthew "finally I was waiting forever for uber eats to arrive"
Travis "I dont think that's uber eats"
??? "I'm going to make sure you're lives are short"
Travis and matthew "hahaha we get it because you're short"
??? "I'm <a href = "lucaspage.html">lucas</a> the bailiff, AND IM HERE TO SLAP YOUR NUTS"
travis and matthew watch in horror as lucas grows to a gargantuan size, growing so tall he breaks through the roof of the apartment into the upstairs neighbor's room.
Lucas "you have not played your taxes you must die"
Harry "you interrupted my lettuce eating!!!!"


    <b>Season 1 episode 7</b>
harry, travis and matthew gase in awe as lucas now grows to be as large as the apartment complex
Harry "HOW DARE YOU INTERRUPT MY LETTUCE EATING"
harry dashes at mach 1 towards lucas, delivering a flurry of blows knocking the titan over destroying half the apartment complex
Matthew "thanks harry, he was about to arrest me for tax fraud"
suddenly a gigantic hand swipes through the apartment knocking the trio through the building and falling 6 stories
travis uses his hair to grab matthew and harry, before they meet a drizzly demise
Lucas "DO YOU KNOW HOW HIGH WE'LL HAVE TO RAISE TAXES NOW TO PAY FOR THIS DAMAGE"
Matthew "thank God I committ tax fraud"
Lucas "I know that, that's why I'm here to arrest you"
Matthew "who told you?"
Lucas "a rather effeminate man told me"
lucas proceeds to unleash all of his strength in one punch at the trio, harry tries his hardest to block it while travis holds Lucas's arm back with his hair
Lucas "YOU CAN NOT ESCAPE PAYING TAXES, IM HERE TO TAKE EVERYTHING YOU OWN IN REPARATION"
matthew curls into a ball and launches himself at lucas. Unfortunately lucas bats matthew away into a nearby apartment
James "I have a front door you know"
Matthew "help, the bailiff... hes here to slap our nuts"


    <b>Season 1 episode 8</b>
James leaps down towards lucas, breaking the sound barrier in the progress, making it seem like he shattered the sky. A golden aura emanates from james as he he punches lucas, sending ripples through the air
James "do you know how long this will take me to clean up."
lucas staggers, barely able to stay on his feet he scans the area for james. Suddenly a ballthew comes hurtling out of what seems nowhere collides with Lucas's arm, breaking it instantly
Lucas "nobody should be exempt from taxes, I won't stop until you have payed"
Lisa "BESTIES WHY THE FUCK IS MY APARTMENT DESTROYED"
Travis "because this skyscraper looking ass bitch thinks were dodging paying taxes"
Matthew "I mean I am"
Lisa "listen taxman bestie, if you look I'll think you find I have played taxes"
lucas looks down at the sheet he was given of people who haven't payed their taxes and it clearly said this apartment complex had not payed in at least 7 months
Lucas "it says right here, that I'm supposed to evict you all for not paying taxes"
Lisa "bestie you've got your facts wrong"
the area around lucas distorted almost as if he was trapped
Harry "what is going on?"
Matthew "lisa is gaslighting lucas into thinking we've payed taxes and that it's all his fault in thinking that we haven't"
Lucas goes back to his normal height and walks off into the distance, not seeming to care about the carnage he has just made
Lisa "James, I hope I can trust you in repairing the apartment"
lisa walks off blissfully into her apartment, weirdly, it was the only one that wasnt destroyed. Matthew, harry and travis sit on a park bench and marvel as James lifts titanic sized debris out of the way and starts rebuilding.
Harry "does anybody want lettuce?"
Matthew "why not"
matthew swallows the lettuce whole while noticing the worried look on travis's face
Matthew "what's wrong"
Travis "don't you see, Toby is back and hes trying to make our life even more worse than it already is living in this shithole of an apartment"
Harry "who is toby?"
Matthew "he was introduced in season 0, you weren't a character then"
Harry "that is a shame, I would've helped fight him, or just sat here and eat lettuce"


    <b>Bregvision Lisa special</b>
we open up to the apartment complex in ruins after the last episode, while lisa ponders life in her room. Lisa sits on her couch enjoying the silence until a loud intermittent beep breaks her peace
Lisa "which bestie is that then"
lisa answers the phone and an ominous effeminate voice emanates from the other end
??? "If you do not tell those who you harbour in your apartment the truth I will bring it to light"
Lisa "BESTIE, I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE, BUT I HAVE A SPECIFIC SKILL THAT WILL ALLOW ME TO MAKE YOUR LIFE MISERABLE"
??? "I'm already sending operatives to free them. Dont be stupid, tell them the truth"the phone disconnects
Lisa's door is suddenly blasted off of its hinges. 4 humanoid figures in full tactical clothing emerge and take aim at lisa
lisa turns to the first figure
Lisa "BESTIE you feel suicidal"
the first figure puts his gun to his mouth and pulls the trigger while lisa turns to the other figures
"Your wife cheated on you with them"
the distorted area appears around the last 3 figures as they take aim at each other and pull the trigger
