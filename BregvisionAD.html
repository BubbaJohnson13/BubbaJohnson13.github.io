The study gained massive media attention when the results were published later that year, leading to the popularity of the show still seen to this day. Sadly just before pilot was aired Dr. ░▒▓▓▓▒ mysteriously vanished and his assistant Dr. Young was promoted to lead writer and owner of the Bregvision™ franchise and its respected copywrites.</p>
